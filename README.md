## Prediksi Diabetes Menggunakan SVM
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze health-related patterns in the data and build an accurate predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. I'm using The dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepikaarikesavan/diabetes-prediction-using-svm

## Project Overview:
The dataset contains medical information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other health indicators. This data is processed and analyzed to extract valuable insights and train a predictive model for diabetes classification.

## Project Goals:
1. Analyze the frequency distribution of glucose levels among patients.
2. Identify BMI ranges most associated with diabetes.
3. Examine the relationship between age and the likelihood of diabetes.
4. Assess the impact of blood pressure on diabetes predictions.
5. Evaluate the performance of the SVM model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

## Key Insights:
1. Glucose Levels: Higher glucose levels strongly correlate with diabetes.
2. BMI: Certain BMI ranges are more common among diabetic patients.
3. Age: Older individuals have a higher risk of diabetes.
4. Blood Pressure: High blood pressure significantly impacts diabetes predictions.
5. Model Performance: The SVM model achieves high accuracy in diabetes classification.
